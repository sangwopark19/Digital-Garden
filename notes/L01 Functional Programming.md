좋아, 어떻게 진행되고 있나요? 컴퓨터 과학 61A에 오신 것을 환영합니다. 이 세계에서 가장 좋은 컴퓨터 과학 수업입니다. 우리는 Scheme이라는 프로그래밍 언어를 사용할 것입니다. 그러나 이 강좌는 Scheme에 관한 수업이 아닙니다. 우리는 STk라는 특정한 Scheme 구현을 사용합니다. 우리는 STk에 식을 입력할 수 있고, 그것은 우리에게 답을 제공할 것입니다. Scheme은 전위 표기법을 사용하며, 연산자가 피연산자보다 먼저 나오는 특징이 있습니다. 이로써 인자의 수에 상관없이 함수를 가질 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 우리는 단순히 (+ 6 8 2 99 4000)를 작성함으로써 6, 8, 2, 99 및 4000의 합을 계산할 수 있습니다.

일부 연산자는 곱셈과 같이 항등 원소인 1을 가지고 있습니다. 따라서 아무 것도 곱하지 않으면 결과는 1이 됩니다. 그러나 모든 함수가 가변 인자를 가지는 것은 아닙니다. 예를 들어, 우리는 인자 없이 나눗셈 함수를 호출할 수 없습니다.

우리는 'quote' 함수를 사용하여 값이 기호 또는 단어인 식을 만들 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, (quote hello)는 우리에게 기호 'hello'를 제공합니다. 또한 함수를 사용하여 단어와 문장을 조작할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 함수 (combine hello world)는 단어 'hello'와 'world'를 이어서 새로운 단어를 형성합니다. 함수 (sentence hello world)는 'hello'와 'world'라는 단어로 문장을 만듭니다.

또한 'define' 키워드를 사용하여 자체 프로시저를 정의할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 우리는 x라는 인수를 가지고 그 제곱을 반환하는 'square'라는 프로시저를 정의할 수 있습니다. 'square' 프로시저를 인수와 함께 호출하면 인수가 프로시저의 본문에 대체되고 식이 평가됩니다.

Scheme에서는 일반적인 프로시저 호출 규칙에 몇 가지 예외가 있습니다. 이 중 하나는 "define" 키워드입니다. "define"를 사용하여 변수에 값을 할당할 때 해당 값은 즉시 평가되지 않습니다. 이것은 변수에 값을 할당하기 전에 변수를 호출하려고하면 오류가 발생한다는 것을 의미합니다. 이는 "define"이 Scheme에서 특별한 형태임을 나타냅니다.

Scheme에는 약 12개의 특수 형태가 있으며, "define"은 학습하는 첫 번째 것입니다. 이번 주에는 몇 개가 더 소개될 것입니다.

이제 이 강좌의 몇 가지 행정적인 사항에 대해 이야기 해 봅시다. 여러분은 방금 전달 받은 것이 있어야 할 핸드아웃이 필요합니다. 곧 다른 핸드아웃도 받게 될 것입니다. 또한 나중에 논의할 컴퓨터 계정 양식을 작성해야 합니다.

이 강좌를 위해 구입해야 할 자료가 몇 가지 있습니다. 가장 중요한 것은 교재입니다. 사용된 것을 구매해도 좋지만, 두 번째 판이라는 것을 확인하십시오. 또한 강의 노트와 Scheme 참조 매뉴얼, 일부 샘플 시험이 포함 된 강의 노트가 있는 큰 부피도 있습니다. 강의 노트를 사용하여 따라가고 필요한 경우에는 메모를 작성하십시오. 참조 매뉴얼은 Scheme 구문에 대한 정보를 찾는 데 유용합니다.

이제 섹션 과제에 대해 이야기해 봅시다. 모든 랩 섹션은 해당 토론 섹션에 연결되어 있으며, 이러한 섹션 내에서 작은 그룹으로 작업하게 됩니다. 중요한 것은 여러분이 개설된 섹션에 참석해야 한다는 것입니다. 그렇지 못한 경우 다른 학생과 교환을 시도할 수 있습니다. 그러나 주의하세요. TA가 섹션에 등록되어 있는지 확인하기 전까지 어떤 양식에도 서명하지 않을 것입니다.

마지막으로, 이 강좌에서는 부정행위를 하지 않는 중요성을 강조하고 싶습니다. 협력은 장려되지만 함께 작업할 수 있는 한계가 있습니다. 부정행위는 동료 학생에게만 불공평한 것뿐만 아니라 학습 과정을 약화시킵니다. 그러니 성실하게 일하고 그룹 구성원을 지원하기 위해 최선을 다해 주시기 바랍니다.

곡선은 있지만 등급은 곡선을 따라가지 않는 것이 좋습니다. 왜냐하면 그렇게 하면 서로 경쟁하는 것이 아니라 협력하는 것이기 때문입니다. 다른 오해 중 하나는 이 강좌에서 부정행위를 하면 캘리포니아 대학의 평판에 해를 끼칠 것이라는 것입니다. 이런, 세 달마다 어떤 축구 선수가 무언가를 하긴 하지만 캘리포니아 대학의 평판은 꽤 괜찮습니다. 그것이 부정행위를 하지 말아야 하는 이유가 아닙니다. 부정행위를 하지 말아야 하는 이유는 다음과 같습니다.

1. 당신은 평생 동안 될 사람을 만들고 있습니다. 인간 행동은 대부분 습관의 문제입니다. 근본적인 수업에서 꼬리를 짤 버린 버릇을 들이면 어떻게 하겠습니까? 그리고 실제로 직장에 입성하고 옆에 앉은 사람이 동일한 일을 하지 않을 때 어떻게 할 것인가요? 당신은 어떤 누군가의 어깨 너머를 볼 수 없을 것입니다. 하지만 당신은 꼬리를 짤 방법을 찾을 것입니다. 나는 이 수업에서 부정행위를 한 사람이 프로그램을 작성한 비행기에 탑승하고 싶지 않습니다.
2. 부정행위에서 어떤 최선의 결과가 나올 수 있을까요? 당신은 스스로 알지 못하고 싫어하는 일을 평생 하는 삶으로 내몰립니다. 그러니 부정행위를 하지 마세요, 만약 그렇게 한다면, 당신은 정말로 스스로를 해치고 있습니다.

이 수업에서 부정행위를 피하는 방법은 간단합니다. 무언가를 이해하지 못하면 그 다음 주까지 기다리지 마세요. 교수님을 귀찮게 생각하지 마세요. 오피스 아워에 와서 도움을 요청하세요. 그게 제 역할입니다.

기타 행정적인 사항:

- 섹션 20과 120에 참여 중인 경우, 랩 및 토론 시간이 서로 반 시간 차이 나게 설정된 것에 대해 사과드립니다. 긴 이야기가 있지만, 최선을 다한 결과입니다.
- 처음에 언급된 CSUA 도움 세션은 이 핸드아웃의 맨 끝에 있습니다.

이제 몇 가지 용어에 대해 알아보겠습니다:

형식 매개변수는 함수에 대한 인수의 이름입니다. 함수의 본체는 정의되는 곳입니다. 실제 인수 표현식은 함수에 대한 입력이며, 실제 인수 값은 입력의 특정 값입니다. 대부분의 경우, 어떤 것을 참조하는지 명백하지만 중요할 때는 명확하게 알려드릴 것입니다.

질문을 하기 위해서는 이 웹캐스트 중이므로 손을 올리는 것을 보지 못할 수 있습니다. 따라서 질문이 있으면 손을 흔들거나 필요하다면 소리를 지르세요.

여기에 여러분이 정의할 수 있는 전형적인 함수가 있습니다:

arduinoCopy code

`(define (plural word) (if (equal? (last word) 'y) (word (butlast word) 'ies) (word word 's)))`

이제 함수의 문제를 해결해 봅시다:

arduinoCopy code

`(define (plural word) (if (equal? (last word) 'y) (word (butlast word) 'ies) (word word 's)))`

그리고 오늘은 여기까지입니다. 행정적인 질문이 있으면 금요일에 물어보세요. 이 핸드아웃에 답이 있다면 당신은 저에게 1달러를 빚지게 됩니다. 그러나 질문이 어리석은 것일지라도 과목 내용에 대해 질문하지 말라는 일은 없습니다. 어리석은 질문이 종종 많은 다른 사람들이 가지고 있는 질문입니다. 따라서 모두에게 유익합니다.

이렇게 하면 단어 중간에 문자가 나타납니다. 네, 맞아요. 첫 번째에서 두 번째로 가져옴으로써 두 번째 문자를 찾았습니다만, 첫 번째에서 가져오기 때문에 그것들의 조합을 만들 수 있습니다. 그러기 위해서, 이것으로 만들어진 또 다른 것도 있습니다. 봅시다, 어, 이건...아니요, 이런 식입니다. 어, 아니에요. 와, 이것은 흥미롭군요. 아마 내가 틀렸을 수도 있습니다. 아마 없을 수도 있습니다. 어, 단어에 대해서는 좋은 질문입니다. 음, 여기에 아이템이 있습니다. 그걸 시도해 봅시다. 아이템, 어, '컴퓨터'에 대한 인덱스를 찾아 봅시다. 네, 여기에 있네요. 아이템. 음, 네, 단어와 문장에 대한 모든 것에 대한 정보를 기억해 주셔서 감사합니다. 이것이 바로 내가 당신의 질문에 손을 교차하고 있었던 이유입니다. 단어와 문장에 관한 모든 것은 이 강좌를 위해 버클리에서 Scheme에 추가한 내용입니다. 보통의 Scheme에서는 참조 매뉴얼과 같은 곳에 단어와 문장이라는 것이 존재하지 않습니다. 그들은 텍스트를 다르게 다룹니다. 이 방법이 더 나아요. 몇 주 후에는 그 기반이 무엇인지 알아볼 것입니다. 하지만 지금은 이 방법으로 생각하는 것이 훨씬 더 쉽습니다. 단어와 문장에 대한 아이디어는 로고라는 언어에서 왔습니다. 로고로 프로그래밍을 해 본 적 있나요? 음, 몇 명이네요. 예전에는 더 많았습니다. 학기가 끝날 때쯤에는 로고 인터프리터를 작성할 때 잘 알게 될 것입니다. 어쨌든, 우리는 그곳에서 단어와 문장이라는 개념을 가져왔고, 그것이 삶을 좀 더 쉽게 만듭니다. 네, 계속하죠. 음, 아마 이걸 하자. 이런 식이죠, cd lectures 1.1. 예, 응. 그의 질문은, 나만의 작은 리더를 작성해서 아포스트로피를 빼 놓을 수 있을까요? 그렇게 하지 않는 것이 좋습니다. 때로는 이 심볼의 값이나 이 프로시저 호출의 값이 무엇인지 알고 싶을 때가 있습니다. 그래서 그것을 만들어내는 것이 좋습니다. 이것은 단순한 문법적인 차이가 아니라 기본적으로 프로그램과 데이터의 차이입니다. 정말 그렇게 생각하지 않는 것이 좋습니다. 그럼, 여기는 Pig Latin 프로그램이 있습니다. Pig Latin을 구사하는 사람이 있나요? 오 마이 갓, 요즘에 학교에서 뭐 가르칩니까? 좋아요, Pig Latin이죠. 어릴 때는 부모님에게 비밀 언어로 쓰이던 언어였습니다. 아마 요즘에는 부모님이 자녀에게 비밀 언어로 사용하고 있을 것입니다. 작동 방식은 단어를 Pig Latin으로 번역하는 것인데, 모든 처음 자음을 끝으로 옮기고 "ay"를 더합니다. 그래서 "pig" + "le" = "ig-pay"가 됩니다. 그러면 이 프로그램이 어떻게 이를 수행할까요? 함께 살펴보겠습니다. 여기서는 "pl-done?"이라는 많은 헬퍼 함수를 사용하고 있습니다. 아마 실제로는 필요 이상으로 많은 헬퍼 함수를 사용하고 있습니다. 제게 주어진 경우 나는 "pl-done?"이라는 것을 갖지 않을 것 같습니다. 그냥 이 식을 여기에 놓을 것 같아요. 그러나 이 작동 방식을 가르치기 위해 "pl-done?"이라는 프레디케이트 함수가 있습니다. 이 함수는 단어를 가져와 "이 단어의 첫 글자가 모음인가?"라는 질문을 합니다. 우리는 "word"의 "first"를 취하고 그것이 "vowel?"에 의해 참 또는 거짓인지를 물어봅니다. 그럼 "vowel?"은 어떻게 작동합니까? 이것은 내장 함수가 아닙니다. 그래서 "member?"는 내장 함수입니다. 우리는 "이 문자가 'aeiou'의 멤버인가?"라고 물어봅니다. 그렇다면 그것은 모음이므로 주어진 단어에 'y'를 추가합니다. 그렇지 않으면 여기가 재미있는 부분입니다. 첫 번째 글자를 제외한 모든 글자를 가져오고 그 후에 첫 번째 글자를 붙입니다. 그래서 주어진 "scheme"이라면 "ch-s"로 변합니다(맨 끝으로 's'를 옮김). 그러나 이것이 원하는 답이 아니기 때문에 "pig"를 그것에 대해 묻습니다. 그래서 여기 전체 식은 "pig-latin" of "word" but "first" of "word"입니다. 이렇게 함으로써 "ch-s"에 대한 "Pig Latin of 'ch-s'"를 계산하게 되고 이것은 "Pig Latin of 'he'"를 계산하게 되고 이것은 "Pig Latin of 'im'"을 계산하게 됩니다. 그리고 그것은 "아하, 이제 모음으로 시작합니다. 끝에 'y'를 붙이겠습니다"라고 말합니다.

All right, how are we doing? Welcome to Computer Science 61A, the best computer science class in the world. We will be using a programming language called Scheme, but this is not a course about Scheme. We are using a particular implementation of Scheme called STk. We can type expressions into STk and it will give us the answer. Scheme uses prefix notation, where the operator comes before the operands. This allows us to have functions with any number of arguments. For example, we can calculate the sum of six, eight, two, ninety-nine, and four thousand by simply writing (+ 6 8 2 99 4000).

Some operators, like multiplication, have an identity element, which is one. So, if we multiply nothing, the result is one. However, not all functions have variable numbers of arguments. For example, we cannot call the division function with no arguments.

We can create expressions whose values are symbols or words by using the quote function. For example, (quote hello) gives us the symbol hello. We can also use functions to manipulate words and sentences. For example, the function (combine hello world) concatenates the words hello and world to form a new word. The function (sentence hello world) creates a sentence with the words hello and world.

We can also define our own procedures using the define keyword. For example, we can define a procedure called square, which takes an argument x and returns the square of x. When we call the square procedure with an argument, the argument is substituted into the body of the procedure and the expression is evaluated.

For Scheme, there are a few exceptions to the ordinary procedure calling rule. One of these exceptions is the "define" keyword. When you use "define" to assign a value to a variable, the value is not immediately evaluated. This means that if you try to call the variable before giving it a value, you will get an error. This is because "define" is a special form in Scheme.

There are about a dozen special forms in Scheme, and "define" is the first one you are learning. There will be a couple more introduced as the week progresses.

Now, let's talk about some administrative things for this course. You will need a handout, which you should have just received. You will also receive another handout shortly. Additionally, you will need to fill out a computer account form, which we will discuss later.

There are some materials you will need to purchase for this course. The most important one is the textbook. You can buy it used if you prefer, but make sure it is the second edition. There is also a course reader, which comes in two volumes. You will only need to buy the new volume one, as volume two does not change from semester to semester.

The big volume contains my lecture notes, as well as the Scheme reference manual and some sample exams. You should use the lecture notes to follow along and take notes if necessary. The reference manual is useful for looking up information about Scheme syntax.

Now, let's discuss the section assignments. Every lab section is linked to a corresponding discussion section, and you will be working in small groups within these sections. It is important that you attend a section that has openings. If you are unable to do so, you can try to make a trade with another student. However, please note that I will not sign any forms until a TA confirms that you are enrolled in a section.

Lastly, I want to emphasize the importance of not cheating in this course. While collaboration is encouraged, there are limits to how much you can work together. Cheating is not only unfair to your fellow students, but it also undermines the learning process. So please, do your best to work honestly and support your group members.

A curve, but it's not grading on a curve is evil because it makes you compete with each other instead of cooperating. So you are not hurting anybody else by doing well in the class. Another misconception is that you are going to harm the reputation of the University of California if you cheat. Now come on, every three or four years some football player does something terrible, but the reputation of the University of California is pretty good. That's not why you shouldn't cheat. Here's why you shouldn't cheat:

1. You are constructing the person you're going to be for the rest of your life. Human behavior is mostly a matter of habits. If you get in the habit of cutting corners early in your career, how are you going to make it through the harder upper division classes? And what are you going to do when you actually get a job and the person next to you isn't doing the same thing? You won't be able to look over somebody's shoulder, but you will find ways to cut corners. And I don't want to fly in an airplane that was programmed by somebody who cheated in this class.
2. What's the best thing that can come out of cheating? You condemn yourself to a life of doing something you don't know how to do and don't like doing. So don't cheat, if you do, you're really hurting yourself.

The way to avoid cheating in this class is simple. If you don't understand something, don't wait till next week to see if it gets better. Don't think you're bothering the professor. Come to office hours and ask for help. That's what I'm here for.

Other administrative things:

- If you're in section 20 and 120, I apologize for the lab and discussion times being half an hour offset from each other. It's a long story, but it was the best we could do.
- The CSUA help sessions mentioned at the beginning are at the very end of this handout.

Now, let's address some vocabulary:

A formal parameter is the name for an argument to a function. The body of a function is where the definition is. The actual argument expression is the input to the function, and the actual argument value is the specific value of the input. In most cases, it's obvious which one is being referred to, but when it matters, we will be clear about it.

Regarding asking questions, since this is being webcast, I might not be able to see your hand in the air. So if you have a question, wave your hand around or yell if needed.

Here's a typical function that you might define:

```
(define (plural word)  (if (equal? (last word) 'y)      (word (butlast word) 'ies)      (word word 's)))
```

Now, let's fix the problem with the function:

```
(define (plural word)  (if (equal? (last word) 'y)      (word (butlast word) 'ies)      (word word 's)))
```

And that's it for today. If you have any administrative questions, you can ask them on Friday. If the answer is in this handout, you owe me a dollar. But don't hesitate to ask course content questions, even if you think they might be stupid. Stupid questions are often the ones that many other people have, so it's beneficial for everyone to ask them.

That gives your character in the middle of a word. Well, yeah. Um, we found the second character by taking the first of, but first so you can make compositions of those. To do that, um, there's also something made up of that. Let's see, uh, I think this...wait, no, it works this way. Um, nope. Whoa, that's interesting. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe there isn't one. Um, for words, good question. Oh, there's item. Let's try that. Item, um, for quote computer. Yeah, there we go. Item. Um, oh yeah, thank you for reminding me all the stuff about words and sentences. This is why I had my fingers crossed in your question. All the stuff about words and sentences is stuff that we added to Scheme here at Berkeley for your benefit in this class. Um, in sort of ordinary Scheme, like in the reference manual, there's no such thing as words and sentences. They deal with text in different ways. This way is better. Um, it's easier. In a few weeks, we'll sort of see what underlies it. Uh, but for now, it's much, much easier to think about it this way. The idea of words and sentences came from a language called Logo. Anybody ever programmed in Logo? Huh, a few people. Um, used to be more than that. Um, you're going to get to know it very well toward the end of the semester when you write a Logo interpreter. Um, but anyway, we've imported this idea of words and sentences from there and it just makes life easier. Um, okay, um, moving on. Oh yeah, let me do this. Whoops, cd lectures 1.1. Yeah, uh-huh. Uh, his question is, can I write my own little reader that lets you leave out the apostrophe? You don't want to because sometimes you really do want to know what's the value of this as a symbol or what's the value of this procedure call. Um, so you really want to make it. It's not just a stupid syntactic distinction. It's the difference between program and data, basically. Um, and it really matters. So I wouldn't think that way if I were you. Um, okay, so here's a little Pig Latin program. Who speaks Pig Latin? Oh my God, what do they teach in school these days? All right, Pig Latin. Um, when I was a kid, it was a secret language that kids used to keep secrets from their parents. I guess these days it's a language that parents use to keep secrets from their kids. Um, and the way it works is to translate a word to Pig Latin, you take all the leading consonants, move them to the end, and add "ay". So, "pig" + "le" = "ig-pay". So we take the "sc" everything up to the first vowel, up to but not including, move it to the end, and add a "y". Okay, now how does this program accomplish that? Let's take a look. It says, if "pl-done?" of word, in this example we are using a lot of helper functions, maybe more than you really need. If I were writing this for my own purposes, I'm not sure I would have something called "pl-done?". I might just put this expression up in there. But for purposes of teaching you how this works, we have a predicate function called "pl-done?" that takes a word and it asks the question, "Is the first letter of this word a vowel?" Right? We take "first" of "word" and then we ask "vowel?" true or false. Now how does "vowel?" work? That's not built in, but "member?" is built in. So we're saying, "Is this letter a member of 'aeiou'?" If so, then it's a vowel and so I take the word that I was given and I add a "y" at the end. Otherwise, here's the fun part. I take all but the first letter and then I stick the first letter after that. So if I'm given "scheme", I turn it into "ch-s" (moving the "s" to the end). But that's not the answer I want, so what I do is I ask for "pig" of that. Okay, so the entire expression here is "pig-latin" of "word" but "first" of "word" and that will compute "Pig Latin of 'ch-s'" which will compute "Pig Latin of 'he'" which will compute "Pig Latin of 'im'" which will say, "Aha, now it starts with a vowel. I'll stick a 'y' at the end".

There

Transcript:
(00:02) all right how are we doing you hear me hear me yeah good okay welcome to computer science 61a uh the best computer science class in the world um and I'm allowed to say that because it's not because of me it's because of this book uh which is called structure and interpretation of computer programs uh which uncoincidentally is also the name of course that you're taking um best computer science book ever written uh you're going to learn an awful lot um okay uh we're using a programming
(00:38) language called scheme I want to emphasize right at the beginning that this is not a course about scheme in fact you're going to learn all of scheme in the next hour and then we can talk about Big Ideas we're using a particular implementation of scheme called STK um here it is and um I should have got ready ahead of time here okay and we can type stuff into it and the way it works is you ask it a question it tells you the answer so I say six it says six um I say plus 6 8 it says 14 um you'll notice in passing that this
(01:29) is not the way you were taught to write addition problems in grade school um the reason that scheme uses this notation is that it can use it uniformly so in math there's infix notation with the operator in the middle for some things and then there's oops then there's prefix notation for other things and then there's postfix [Music] notation and then all around the operator or the operand I mean notation for yet other things um so this is not very uniform and also hardly any of these work very well if is more than two
(02:32) oper so we standardize on having the operator first and that means I can say what's the sum of six and 8 and two and 99 and 4,000 and it'll work okay what do you think four yeah what do you think ah here's some errors and some zeros it's actually zero um but times one um because that's the identity element for the multiplication operator so it sort of makes sense mathematically to do that um some other operators um don't like doing that so it's not every function that has variable num yeah VAR ible numbers of arguments you
(03:31) can't call division with no arguments um how about if I just say plus not in parenthesis error nope um I know that looks like it might be an error message but it isn't um this is the way that's STK represents functions so the value of the symbol plus sign is a function the same as uh you know you always learn that you know sign is a function um so it's plus okay um good what if I would like to have an expression whose value is the plus symbol I can do that as follows um I say quote is the bottom showing up yes great
(04:27) um quote plus sign uh that I don't know if you can see clearly back there in the back but it's actually a single quote otherwise known as an apostrophe um and quote followed by any word the value of that is just that word so if I say hello I get an error so I'm asking what's the value of the symbol hello and there isn't a value but if I say quote hello I get back hello okay question so far great um we can take the result of one function and use it as an argument to another function so I can say add
(05:14) up 3 * 7 and 10 * 10 okay that's called composition of functions you learned about it in seventh or eighth grade um and it turns out to be such a powerful mechanism for organizing computations that it's basically all we need so you now know uh we're like 15 no we're five minutes into the class you've now learned about 90% of the scheme language okay namely parenthesis function argument argument argument argument however many there are close parenthesis means call this function with these argument values okay um and
(06:04) what scheme does is first it evaluates the argument Expressions so it evaluates for example time 37 gets 21 it evaluates time 10 10 gets 100 and then it calls finally the plus function with those values okay so first evaluate the arguments then call the function with the actual argument values that's it that's the language um well almost um first of all not all functions are functions of numbers um I can say something like first of quote hello and get H or last of quote hello get o or but first quote hello congratulations on not
(07:03) laughing get l or but last oh hello they wouldn't let me do this if we were teaching in Texas um uh we can abbreviate these things by the way but first BF and so on okay so those are functions um there's a Constructor function called word here's my favorite example now and here combine them and it just sort of buts them up together makes a new word that's the two concatenated um there's also sentence which you can abbreviate SE and it makes something we haven't seen before which is a sentence which is
(07:52) a bunch of words in parentheses okay um now notice this is something scheme is printing out as a result this sentence if I were to type in parenthesis now here close parenthesis that would not mean I want the sentence now here it would mean please call the function named now with the argument named here okay if I actually want a sentence I quote it the same as you can quote a word okay um first but first last but last applied to
(08:55) sentences carves out pieces that are words so but for first of um all but the first word okay and these can be composed also so I can say uh first of but first of um we got whoops oh sorry programming in logo to while there we go so first of butt first what does that do well butt first of a hard day night is hard day night and first of hard days night is hard right how about first of first oops I keep doing it first of first of but
(10:04) first of um he loves you what am i g to get L yeah first letter of the first word of all but the first word oh she loves you okay great um can you guys listen and hand and pass out handouts at the same time without reading the handout guest them around if you're really smart we can do this in order of the end time just going to start this halfway
(11:08) back last you go that was only tur box all right tell you what could you take these and just pass them straight back until they get like four rows from the end and then people should start
(12:17) taking and same for you and okay the first row that doesn't have handouts can start this one when it gets to you straight back and you don't get very many let's do that that's and that okay the other 10% of language uh we can give names to things so I can say
(13:28) for now if I and here's the area of a circle of radius five um I can Define procedures and that please than there we go oh wow so l out um usually by convention you just go to
(14:34) another line to put the defin the actual body of the procedure but it's only a convention a scheme treats a new line the same way it treats a space it's just a separator um oops so now um I've defined a procedure by the way notice when you say Define what you get back is um as The Returned value is the name that you're defining so um up here I defined pi and it it said pi and here I'm defining square and it says Square um so what does this mean it means when you call square with an argument like if I say square
(15:22) of + 23 what happens first plus 23 first thing we do is evaluate the sub Expressions to get the argument values now we're also by the way evaluating this sub expression whose value is the function we're calling so we get the value five good um and now in the body of square which is this expression here wherever we see an X we put in five and so we get time 5 five and that's 25 okay um so that's the rule of uh evaluation for scheme almost always um there are a few exceptions uh one of the exceptions is
(16:17) Define itself because when I say Define pi at the time I say this Pi has no value value so if this Ed the ordinary procedure calling rule of first evaluate the argument expressions and then call the function I we get an error on this call to Define Unbound variable Pi um and the same here um Square X well if I haven't defined Square yet this doesn't mean anything and this although it looks as if it means something it actually doesn't until we substitute some value for this these X's right so Define is what's called a
(17:07) special form um actually technically the whole expression that you type is called a special form Define is called a keyword um which is the name of a special form and what's special about it is that it doesn't do this thing of first evaluate the arguments Etc um actually it depends which kind of Define and you'll learn why this is in a week when we look under the rug here under the hood of this but if I say Define hello to be+ 23 uh the value of hello is five right it's not plus 23 this got evaluated If This Were inside
(17:54) parentheses then we'd be defining a function and then nothing would be evaluated until we call the function okay great um there are oh maybe a dozen um they say in teacher school you're supposed to say any phone that rings in my class is mine but um I'll let you off the hook this time [Music] um oh yeah Special forms there's about a dozen of them um Define is the first one that you're learning and we'll see a couple more um as this week progresses okay let me take uh a couple of minutes to talk
(18:45) about administrative things um what you need in the way of materials for this course you need the handout that I hope you just got who doesn't have a handout okay anybody who has more than one hand out there send them that way to the top right your right here they come great um so you need a handout you need another handout that you're going to get in a minute um you need a computer account form and I'll talk about that in a second those are the things we give you and then there's some things you have to
(19:24) buy uh the most important one is the textbook um you can buy it used if you want if you do make sure it's the second edition not the first edition um Second Edition out for a long time so it probably is but check um in my opinion you're going to want to keep this book forever and sleep with it under your pillow um but you know there is a used Market because I guess not everybody agrees with me um there's also a course reader it comes in two volumes a thin volume one and a thick volume two uh the reason it comes in two volumes is
(20:04) that you have to get a brand new this semester's volume one for $941 but if you find a used volume two that's okay volume two is the stuff that doesn't change from semester to semester um you need the volume one because it has all of your assignments for the entire semester are in here all the labs all the homeworks all the projects are in here um so that's important what's in the big fat one one thing is my lecture notes so my goal is that you shouldn't have to write stuff down in here um and
(20:42) that's because I vaguely remember being a student and I can't think and write at the same time and I want you to be thinking in here okay so you get my lecture notes you can read along if you know I seem to be saying something that isn't quite in here or a clarification you can scribble it in the margin but mostly you should be listening and thinking and not writing um another important thing that's in here is the scheme reference manual so if you have a question about you know what's the order
(21:15) of the arguments to such and such uh you can look it up okay um other really important things in the big volume um is some sample exams so you can get an idea of what the exams are like there are way too many exams in this course we give three midterms and a final I keep trying to cut back and students always insist that we have to do this which sounds kind of masochistic but the reason is the fewer exams there are the more it matters to your grade if you totally mess up one problem so students like to have a lot
(21:58) lot of problems to sort of smooth out their errors in the midterms um so that means that the Tas and I are pretty much constantly either writing an exam or grading an exam um which is the only bad thing about teaching in this class well that an arguing with students at back grades that's another bad part um okay uh let me hand out the other handout actually it's only one page this is the last minute update so here you go pass those around pass those around um what's in the last minute update uh mainly is information about uh
(22:48) which ta is teaching which section um when and where they meet and the all important which sections have rooms so if you are on the way waiting list for this class or if you're an extension student and want me to sign you into the class the answer is we have enough spaces for everyone okay everyone will get in provided that you are willing to meet at a section time that has openings okay so you have to mute us halfway about this if you absolutely can't meet any of the sections times that have openings you can attempt to make a
(23:32) trade with someone else um and there's two ways to do that one is to just sort of show up at the section you're trying to get into and ask the TA if you can just yell out um hey can anybody take Section such and such that I'm enrolled in but you should enroll in a section even if you don't like the time enroll in one of the open sections that will get you into the class if you want me to sign a form because you're an extension student I'm not going to sign your form until a TA signs at first saying that you're in
(24:09) a lab and discussion section okay um so I want to make sure that everybody's really in a section it matters a lot um the lab and discussion sections you probably all figured this out already are linked so if you're in lab section 15 you're discussion section 115 they go together um and it's the same ta and the same students and that's good because you're going to be working in small groups and you really get to know your partners so a week from now your ta is going to organize you into groups of
(24:45) four and you are really going to get to know this group of four very well because you're going to collaborate on some projects you're going to collaborate on some exam questions there will be a couple of group questions where your whole group gets together to we out the answer to something I really recommend that you study together um and please do your best to make sure that nobody in your group gets lost and dispares and drops out okay try to support your group members why because your entire group gets bonus
(25:22) points if the lowest scoring person on an exam from your group gains Five Points in the next exam okay so if you can take your sort of weakest link in your group and support that person to really do better uh you get two bonus points if that person drops out you don't okay so this is a reward for working together um having said that there are limits to your working together um you're going to be hearing this from every single instructor this week right you've probably already heard it six times don't
(26:05) cheat um I think that some of what people tell you about this is nonsense uh for example people will tell you that you're hurting your fellow students by cheating uh that would be true if this course were graded on a curve but it's not um grading on a curve is evil because it makes you comp compete with each other instead of cooperating um so you are not hurting anybody else by doing well in the class another thing that I've heard people say that isn't true is that you are going to harm the reputation of the University of
(26:43) California if you cheat now come on every three or four years some football player rapes a towy at a fraternity party and that's terrible but the reputation of the University of California is pretty good um so that's not why you shouldn't cheat here's why you shouldn't cheat you guys right now are constructing the person you're going to be for the rest of your life um human behavior is mostly a matter of habits people talk as if you make big decisions all the time about what to do but that's not true almost
(27:41) all the time you just do what you're in the habit of doing if you get in the habit of cutting Corners this early in your career you know how are you going to make it through the harder upper division classes and then what are you going to do when you actually get a job and the person next to you isn't doing the same thing you're doing okay you're not going to be able to look over somebody's shoulder but you are going to be able to find ways to cut corners and I don't want to fly in an airplane that
(28:15) was programmed by somebody who cheated in this class okay so really and furthermore what's the best thing that can come out of cheating you uh condemn yourself to a life of doing something you don't know how to do and don't like doing okay so don't cheat if you do you're really hurting yourself um and the thing to do instead the way to avoid cheating um in this class I don't believe we've ever had the kind of conspiracy you read about in the newspapers where somebody breaks into the professor's office you know and blah
(28:57) blah that doesn't happen what happens is people panic at the last minute and cheat the way to avoid that is if you don't understand something don't think I'm GNA wait till next week and see if it gets better don't think I don't want to bother the poor Professor uh it's what I'm here for come to my office hours come to your ta's office hours the very minute you don't understand something okay good so don't cheat um other administrative things if you're in section 20 and 120 I really apologize
(29:35) for the fact that the lab and discussion times are half an hour offset from each other um it's a long story um but was the best we could do um and the csua help sessions that you were told about right at the beginning are at the very end of this one-page last minute handout um okay uh that's it all of your other administrative questions are answered in this handout so I would prefer not to have administrative questions today you can ask administrative questions on Friday if the answer is in this handout you owe
(30:16) me a dollar okay I don't feel that way about course content questions if you ask the very same question that somebody asked a minute ago because you didn't understand the answer that's fine okay don't refrain from asking questions because you think it's a stupid question stupid questions are the best ones because if you have a stupid question then probably 50 other people in this room have the same question whereas if you ask uh I'm going to prove how smart I am question then you know you won't make any
(30:55) friends um all right let's get back to work yeah oh uh okay are there last minute handouts to pile them somewhere on the back okay hands up if you don't have one okay so people who have the big pile pass it for some of it that way and some of it down here okay we should have just about enough I hope if not we'll make more um oh let me write this down one administrative thing that I should have put in the hand out but I'm not sure I did Jenny is the staff support person for this class among other things and if
(31:58) you're missing a handout or something um you know you need to reschedule exam she's the one to see um okay back to work oh yeah so okay here's your vocabulary lesson for today this thing is called a formal parameter you don't have to write it down it's in
(33:02) my electron notes just understand it so the formal parameter is the name for an argument to a function right um this thing here is the body okay those things are part of the definition of a function this is the actual argument expression and then a sort of invisible thing is the actual argument value which is is five okay so there are three things that can Loosely be called the arguments of the function there's X
(34:05) which is its formal parameter there's plus two3 which is its actual argument expression and there's five which is its actual argument value almost all the time either it's obvious which one I mean or I kind of mean all of them together and I'll just say the argument or the input even um when it matters those are the names and we'll try to be clear about that okay oh yeah about asking questions um they uh because they're webcasting this and everything they're shining bright lights in my eyes and so
(34:41) um I might not be able to see your hand in the air and if that's the case wave it around um this is this is your physiology lesson for today uh your eye sees moving things a lot better than stationary things um so I really see your hand better if it's moving uh if that doesn't work yell um okay so here's a typical function that you might Define so I can say plural computer here is plural book plural Point notice I'm quoting the words that I'm using as inputs because quote computer is the
(35:46) actual argument expression and computer is the actual argument value or book or boy okay um well there's a problem with this it doesn't quite work that's the wrong answer right so I'm going to fix it word oh one little comment before I go on I used WD as the formal parameter why didn't I just use word it's not just cuz I'm a lazy typist it's because in the body of plural I'm using a primitive function called word w r d and it has to have a different name from this okay a name can only mean one thing
(36:41) at a time so that's why you'll see me use wood for words and scent for sentences as uh as formal parameters okay so if what what's different about fly it ends in a y equal question mark equal question mark is a built-in predicate function a predicate is a function that Returns the value true or false okay it's not a rule built into the language that predicates have to end in question mark it's a convention that they almost always do it just helps you read programs more easily although it actually in one way makes it hard reps
(37:27) you have to say if equal or something it's like Chinese where the uh tone matters um so if the last letter of wood is equal to quote y last of word is a procedure call but the Y I actually want the letter Y itself so it's quoted so if those are equal then I'm going to return word all but the last letter of my argument word and then I S otherwise same as before word would quote s so book still works fly works but a broken
(38:34) boy you're going to fix that in the lab okay um if is a special form yes okay question is There's no distinction between a character and a string with only one character in it um that's right these are my crossed fingers here um um if you read the reference manual you'll see that there is but for our purposes uh there are neither characters nor strings there are words and there are sentences okay yeah hush a string is a bunch of characters in in those other languages um yes is there a function that gives your
(39:37) character in the middle of a word well yeah um we found the second character Remember by taking first of but first so you can make compositions of those to do that um there's also um something made up of that um let's see uh I think this wait no it works this way um NOP whoa that's interesting Maybe I'm Wrong maybe there isn't one um for Words good question oh there's item let's try that item um for quote computer yeah there we go item um oh yeah thank you for reminding me all the stuff about words and
(40:40) sentences this is why I had my fingers crossed in your question all the stuff about words and sentences is stuff that we added to scheme here at Berkeley for your benefit in this class um in sort of ordinary scheme like in the reference manual uh there's no such thing as words and sentences they deal with text in different ways this way is better um it's easier uh in a few weeks we'll sort of see what underlies it uh but for now it's much much easier to think about it this way the idea of words and sentences
(41:15) came from a language called logo anybody ever programmed in logo huh a few people um used to be more than that um you're going to get to know it very well uh toward the end of the semester when you write a logo interpreter um but anyway we've imported this idea of words and sentences from there and it it just makes life easier um okay um moving on oh yeah let me do this whoops CD lectures 1.
(41:59) 1 yeah uhuh uh his question is can I write it my own little reader that does lets you leave out the apostrophe you don't want to because sometimes you really do want to know what's the value of this as a symbol or what's the value of this procedure call um so you really want to make it it's not just a stupid syntactic distinction it's the difference between program and data basically um and it really matters so I wouldn't think that way if I were you um okay so here's a little pig latin
(42:52) program who speaks Pig Latin oh my God what do they teach in school these days all right um Pig Latin um when I was a kid was a secret language that kids used to keep secrets from their parents I guess these days it's a language that parents use to keep secrets from their kids um and the way it works is to translate a word to Pig Latin you take all the leading consonants move them to the end and add ay so piggle whoops piggle of scheme for example Le is imke so we take the SC everything up to the first vowel up
(43:36) to but not including move it to the end and add a y okay now how does this program accomplish that let's take a look it says if PL done question mark of word in this example we are using a lot of helper functions maybe more than you really need if I were writing this for my own purposes I'm not sure I would have something called PL done question mark I might just put this expression uh up in there but um for purposes of teaching you how this works we have a predicate function called PL done that takes a
(44:15) word and it asks the question is the first letter of this word a vowel right we take first of word and then we ask vowel true or false now how does vowel work that's not built in but member question mark is built in so we're saying is this letter a member of AE I oou if so then um it's a vowel and so I take the word that I was given and I add a y at the end otherwise here's the fun part I take all but the first letter and then I stick the first letter after that so if I'm given scheme I turn it
(45:17) into CHS moving the s to the end but that's not the answer I want so what I do is I ask for pig of that okay so the entire expression here is pigle word but first of word first of word and that will compute Pig Latin of chims which will compute Pig Latin of he which will compute Pig Latin of IM which will say aha now it starts with a vowel I'll stick a y at the end there was a hand up yes equ okay the question was instead of member here can I use equal question mark right that's where you mean um no
(46:06) you can't um that letter e for example is that letter e equal to this sentence no it sure isn't for one thing it's a word not a sentence and for another thing it's just e not e um so no member is what you want okay yes oh why did I use letter as the argument down here oh I use letter here because I used it here letter is the formal parameter to procedure vowel question mark okay so when we call vowel question question mark I say like for example vowel question mark of s we're going to substitute s for the formal parameter in
(47:05) this expression okay so that's why scheme doesn't care what word you use as a formal parameter um as long as it's not the name of a primitive or something that you need uh you can use any word you want but you use a word that helps you understand so here my argument is a whole word of you know many letter here the argument is always going to be a single letter so I'm reminding myself of that by the name that I picked okay yes ah what if I use the word Rhythm I would be in trouble because this has a
(47:43) pretty simplistic sense of what a vowel is that's true it's very complicated to figure out whether Y is a vowel or not so I didn't do it for purposes of demonstration here but let me get to the important point about this um this is procedure piggle because we only have a couple of minutes this is procedure piggle and here it is calling itself how can that work this is the idea of recursion which is a function calling itself recursive programming is a prerequisite for this class if this is new to you a procedure that calls
(48:16) itself uh maybe you should take cs10 before you take cs61a okay that's the prerequisite for 61a we assume that this is all old hat to you if is a special form it has to be because if we evaluated this recursive call before we called if then even when we got to the base case to the word that starts with a vowel we would still try to do the recursive call over and over and over again if being a special form it has its own evaluation rule which is it starts by evaluating its first argument expression that has to be true or false
(49:03) if it's true we evaluate the second one and forget about the third one if it's false we evaluate the third one and forget about the second one okay so that's if is a special form um and uh let's see we have one minute left who doesn't have a big handout who doesn't have a little handout oh gez okay anybody who has extra handout don't get don't go yet very rude anybody who has extra handouts please pass them down to the front and people who don't have them will pick them up also you guys
(49:43) should be listening and not leaving this might affect you um if you are enrolled in one of the sections that has not had a scheduled lab yet that would be sections 20 and 21 whose lab meets oh sorry most important thing this week only both section meetings the one that already happened and the one that would ordinarily be a discussion are meeting in the lab so this afternoon or tomorrow or Friday morning you're meeting in the lab if you're in sections 20 or 21 then um your ta doesn't have your account forms because just printed some
(50:26) up so people in those sections only I just have enough um should come up and get I'm going to leave them not on the stage because they're going to rotate it but here um an account form if you're in some other section your ta has your account forms if you're on the waiting list but you're going to be in section 20 or 21 then hang around and we'll see if it works okay um see you Friday thank you

​``The Shorthand Guide to Everything Claude Code Here's my complete setup after 10 months of daily use: skills, hooks, subagents, MCPs, plugins, and what actually works. Been an avid Claude Code user since the experimental rollout in Feb, and won the Anthropic x Forum Ventures hackathon with Zenith alongside @DRodriguezFX completely using Claude Code. --- ## Skills and Commands Skills operate like rules, constricted to certain scopes and workflows. They're shorthand to prompts when you need to execute a particular workflow. After a long session of coding with Opus 4.5, you want to clean out dead code and loose .md files? Run `/refactor-clean`. Need testing? `/tdd`, `/e2e`, `/test-coverage`. Skills and commands can be chained together in a single prompt. I can make a skill that updates codemaps at checkpoints - a way for Claude to quickly navigate your codebase without burning context on exploration. `~/.claude/skills/codemap-updater.md` Commands are skills executed via slash commands. They overlap but are stored differently: - Skills: `~/.claude/skills` - broader workflow definitions   - Commands: `~/.claude/commands` - quick executable prompts   ```bash # Example skill structure ~/.claude/skills/   pmx-guidelines.md    # Project-specific patterns  coding-standards.md  # Language best practices  tdd-workflow/        # Multi-file skill with README.md  security-review/     # Checklist-based skill``

## Hooks

Hooks are trigger-based automations that fire on specific events. Unlike skills, they're constricted to tool calls and lifecycle events.

Hook Types

1. PreToolUse - Before a tool executes (validation, reminders)
    
2. PostToolUse - After a tool finishes (formatting, feedback loops)
    
3. UserPromptSubmit - When you send a message
    
4. Stop - When Claude finishes responding
    
5. PreCompact - Before context compaction
    
6. Notification - Permission requests
    

Example: tmux reminder before long-running commands

json

`{   "PreToolUse": [    {      "matcher": "tool == \"Bash\" && tool_input.command matches \"(npm|pnpm|yarn|cargo|pytest)\"",      "hooks": [        {          "type": "command",          "command": "if [ -z \"$TMUX\" ]; then echo '[Hook] Consider tmux for session persistence' >&2; fi"        }      ]    }  ] }`

Pro tip: Use the `hookify` plugin to create hooks conversationally instead of writing JSON manually. Run `/hookify` and describe what you want.

## Subagents

Subagents are processes your orchestrator (main Claude) can delegate tasks to with limited scopes. They can run in background or foreground, freeing up context for the main agent.

Subagents work nicely with skills - a subagent capable of executing a subset of your skills can be delegated tasks and use those skills autonomously. They can also be sandboxed with specific tool permissions.

bash

`# Example subagent structure ~/.claude/agents/   planner.md            # Feature implementation planning  architect.md          # System design decisions  tdd-guide.md          # Test-driven development  code-reviewer.md      # Quality/security review  security-reviewer.md  # Vulnerility analysis  build-error-resolver.md  e2e-runner.md  refactor-cleaner.md`

Configure allowed tools, MCPs, and permissions per subagent for proper scoping.

---

## Rules and Memory

Your `.rules` folder holds `.md` files with best practices Claude should ALWAYS follow. Two approaches:

1. Single `CLAUDE.md` - Everything in one file (user or project level)
    
2. Rules folder - Modular `.md` files grouped by concern
    

bash

`~/.claude/rules/   security.md      # No hardcoded secrets, validate inputs  coding-style.md  # Immutability, file organization  testing.md       # TDD workflow, 80% coverage  git-workflow.md  # Commit format, PR process  agents.md        # When to delegate to subagents  performance.md   # Model selection, context management`

Example rules:

- No emojis in codebase
    
- Refrain from purple hues in frontend
    
- Always test code before deployment
    
- Prioritize modular code over mega-files
    
- Never commit console.logs
    

---

## MCPs (Model Context Protocol)

MCPs connect Claude to external services directly. Not a replacement for APIs - it's a prompt-driven wrapper around them, allowing more flexibility in navigating information.

Example: Supabase MCP lets Claude pull specific data, run SQL directly upstream without copy-paste. Same for databases, deployment platforms, etc.

Chrome in Claude: is a built-in plugin MCP that lets Claude autonomously control your browser - clicking around to see how things work.

CRITICAL: Context Window Management  
Be picky with MCPs. I keep all MCPs in user config but disable everything unused. Navigate to `/plugins` and scroll down or run `/mcp`.

Your 200k context window before compacting might only be 70k with too many tools enabled. Performance degrades significantly.

Rule of thumb: Have 20-30 MCPs in config, but keep under 10 enabled / under 80 tools active.

---

## Plugins

Plugins package tools for easy installation instead of tedious manual setup. A plugin can be a skill + MCP combined, or hooks/tools bundled together.

Installing plugins:

bash

`# Add a marketplace claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/mixedbread-ai/mgrep # Open Claude, run /plugins, find new marketplace, install from there`

LSP Plugins: are particularly useful if you run Claude Code outside editors frequently. Language Server Protocol gives Claude real-time type checking, go-to-definition, and intelligent completions without needing an IDE open.

bash

`# Enabled plugins example typescript-lsp@claude-plugins-official  # TypeScript intelligence pyright-lsp@claude-plugins-official     # Python type checking hookify@claude-plugins-official         # Create hooks conversationally mgrep@Mixedbread-Grep                   # Better search than ripgrep`

Same warning as MCPs - watch your context window.

## Tips and Tricks

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- Ctrl+U - Delete entire line (faster than backspace spam)
    
- ! - Quick bash command prefix
    
- @ - Search for files
    
- / - Initiate slash commands
    
- Shift+Enter - Multi-line input
    
- Tab - Toggle thinking display
    
- Esc Esc - Interrupt Claude / restore code
    

## Parallel Workflows

`/fork` - Fork conversations to do non-overlapping tasks in parallel instead of spamming queued messages.

## Git Worktrees

For overlapping parallel Claudes without conflicts. Each worktree is an independent checkout.

bash

`git worktree add ../feature-branch feature-branch # Now run separate Claude instances in each worktree`

## tmux for Long-Running Commands

Stream and watch logs/bash processes Claude runs.

bash

`tmux new -s dev # Claude runs commands here, you can detach and reattach tmux attach -t dev`

## mgrep > grep

`mgrep` is a significant improvement from ripgrep/grep. Install via plugin marketplace, then use the `/mgrep` skill. Works with both local search and web search.

bash

`mgrep "function handleSubmit"               # Local search mgrep --web "Next.js 15 app router changes" # Web search`

Other Useful Commands

- `/rewind` - Go back to a previous state
    
- `/statusline` - Customize with branch, context %, todos
    
- `/checkpoints` - File-level undo points
    
- `/compact` - Manually trigger context compaction
    

## GitHub Actions CI/CD

Set up code review on your PRs with GitHub Actions. Claude can review PRs automatically when configured.

## Sandboxing

Use sandbox mode for risky operations - Claude runs in restricted environment without affecting your actual system. (Use `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to do the opposite of this and let Claude roam free, this can be destructive if not careful.)

---

## On Editors

While an editor isn't needed it can positively or negatively impact your Claude Code workflow. While Claude Code works from any terminal, pairing it with a capable editor unlocks real-time file tracking, quick navigation, and integrated command execution.

## Zed (My Preference)

I use Zed - a Rust-based editor that's lightweight, fast, and highly customizable.

Why Zed works well with Claude Code:

- Agent Panel Integration - Zed's Claude integration lets you track file changes in real-time as Claude edits. Jump between files Claude references without leaving the editor
    
- Performance - Written in Rust, opens instantly and handles large codebases without lag
    
- CMD+Shift+R Command Palette - Quick access to all your custom slash commands, debuggers, and tools in a searchable UI. Even if you just want to run a quick command without switching to terminal
    
- Minimal Resource Usage - Won't compete with Claude for system resources during heavy operations
    
- Vim Mode - Full vim keybindings if that's your thing
    

1. Split your screen - Terminal with Claude Code on one side, editor on the other
    
2. Ctrl + G - Quickly open the file Claude is currently working on in Zed
    
3. Auto-save - Enable autosave so Claude's file reads are always current
    
4. Git integration - Use editor's git features to review Claude's changes before committing
    
5. File watchers - Most editors auto-reload changed files, verify this is enabled
    

## VSCode / Cursor

This is also a viable choice and works well with Claude Code. You can use it in either terminal format, with automatic sync with your editor using `\ide` enabling LSP functionality (somewhat redundant with plugins now). Or you can opt for the extension which is more integrated with the Editor and has a matching UI.

## MCP Servers

Configured (User Level):

json

`{   "github": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"] },  "firecrawl": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "firecrawl-mcp"] },  "supabase": {    "command": "npx",    "args": ["-y", "@supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest", "--project-ref=YOUR_REF"]  },  "memory": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"] },  "sequential-thinking": {    "command": "npx",    "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]  },  "vercel": { "type": "http", "url": "https://mcp.vercel.com" },  "railway": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@railway/mcp-server"] },  "cloudflare-docs": { "type": "http", "url": "https://docs.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp" },  "cloudflare-workers-bindings": {    "type": "http",    "url": "https://bindings.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp"  },  "cloudflare-workers-builds": { "type": "http", "url": "https://builds.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp" },  "cloudflare-observability": {    "type": "http",    "url": "https://observability.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp"  },  "clickhouse": { "type": "http", "url": "https://mcp.clickhouse.cloud/mcp" },  "AbletonMCP": { "command": "uvx", "args": ["ableton-mcp"] },  "magic": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@magicuidesign/mcp@latest"] } }`

Disabled per project (context window management):

text

`# In ~/.claude.json under projects.[path].disabledMcpServers disabledMcpServers: [   "playwright",  "cloudflare-workers-builds",  "cloudflare-workers-bindings",  "cloudflare-observability",  "cloudflare-docs",  "clickhouse",  "AbletonMCP",  "context7",  "magic" ]`

This is the key - I have 14 MCPs configured but only ~ 5-6 enabled per project. Keeps context window healthy.

## Key Hooks

json

`{   "PreToolUse": [    // tmux reminder for long-running commands    { "matcher": "npm|pnpm|yarn|cargo|pytest", "hooks": ["tmux reminder"] },    // Block unnecessary .md file creation    { "matcher": "Write && .md file", "hooks": ["block unless README/CLAUDE"] },    // Review before git push    { "matcher": "git push", "hooks": ["open editor for review"] }  ],  "PostToolUse": [    // Auto-format JS/TS with Prettier    { "matcher": "Edit && .ts/.tsx/.js/.jsx", "hooks": ["prettier --write"] },    // TypeScript check after edits    { "matcher": "Edit && .ts/.tsx", "hooks": ["tsc --noEmit"] },    // Warn about console.log    { "matcher": "Edit", "hooks": ["grep console.log warning"] }  ],  "Stop": [    // Audit for console.logs before session ends    { "matcher": "*", "hooks": ["check modified files for console.log"] }  ] }`

## Rules Structure

text

`~/.claude/rules/   security.md     # Mandatory security checks  coding-style.md # Immutability, file size limits  testing.md      # TDD, 80% coverage  git-workflow.md # Conventional commits  agents.md       # Subagent delegation rules  patterns.md     # API response formats  performance.md  # Model selection (Haiku vs Sonnet vs Opus)  hooks.md        # Hook documentation`

## Subagents

text

`~/.claude/agents/   planner.md          # Break down features  architect.md        # System design  tdd-guide.md        # Write tests first  code-reviewer.md    # Quality review  security-reviewer.md# Vulnerability scan  build-error-resolver.md  e2e-runner.md       # Playwright tests  refactor-cleaner.md # Dead code removal  doc-updater.md      # Keep docs synced`

---

## Key Takeaways

1. Don't overcomplicate - treat configuration like fine-tuning, not architecture
    
2. Context window is precious - disable unused MCPs and plugins
    
3. Parallel execution - fork conversations, use git worktrees
    
4. Automate the repetitive - hooks for formatting, linting, reminders
    
5. Scope your subagents - limited tools = focused execution
